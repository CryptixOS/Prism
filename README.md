# ✨ Prism

**Prism** is a modern C++ standard library and runtime environment tailored for freestanding and kernel-space development. It powers the core of [CryptixOS](https://github.com/CryptixOS/CryptixOS), offering high-performance, modular, and allocator-aware components built from scratch for environments without a standard C++ runtime.

## 🚀 Goals

- 📦 Freestanding and header-only (where possible)
- 🧠 Designed for kernel use and low-level systems programming
- 💎 Clean, STL-like API with zero-cost abstractions
- 🛠 No dependencies on libstdc++, libc++, or libm

---

## 📚 Features

### 🌿 Core Types
- `BasicString`, `Vector`, `Deque`, `UnorderedMap`, `RedBlackTree`, `Optional`, `Span`, etc.
- SSO-enabled string implementation (`BasicString`)

### 🔧 Utilities
- `Format` — type-safe formatting engine (like `fmtlib`)
- `Expected`, `Result`, `ErrorCode` — error handling without exceptions
- Type traits, concepts, and compile-time utilities
- Smart pointers: `Ref`, `Box`, `Unique`, `Weak`

### 🧪 Testing Support
- Minimal `assert`-based test framework
- Kernel-friendly output via serial or logging interface

---

## 💻 Usage

Prism is integrated with CryptixOS, but it can be used in any freestanding or embedded project. Just add the `Prism` source tree to your build and configure it as a system or static library.

> Note: Prism assumes a freestanding environment — no exceptions, RTTI, or dynamic allocations unless explicitly provided.

## 🙌 Credits

Prism is inspired by the design goals of:
- The C++ STL (with a focus on zero overhead)
- `fmtlib`, `abseil`, and `eastl`
- Operating system development principles (e.g. SerenityOS, Redox, linux, managarm, toaros)
